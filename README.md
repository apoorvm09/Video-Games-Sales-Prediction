# Video-Games-Sales-Prediction
•	The objective is to predict the sales of video game around the globe by understanding the data in hand.

•	I have cleaned the data by performing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), treating null values and outliers, and used some graphical representations for easy interpretation. 

•	After cleaning all the data, I have built a Linear Regression model with the help of which we can predict the future sales of video game.


Dataset- It was obtained from a hackathon organised by skillenza.
